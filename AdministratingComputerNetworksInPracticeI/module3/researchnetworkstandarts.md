### Lab - Research Networking Standards

1. 
Jonathan Bruce Postel (August 6, 1943 â€“ October 16, 1998) was a pivotal American computer scientist instrumental in the development of the Internet. He served as the editor of the Request for Comments (RFC) series from its inception in 1969 until his death in 1998, shaping many foundational Internet standards. Postel also managed the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), overseeing critical aspects of Internet infrastructure, including IP address allocation and domain name system management. His contributions to protocols like TCP/IP, SMTP, and DNS have left a lasting impact on how the Internet functions today.

Vinton Cerf, often called one of the "fathers of the Internet," has made several key contributions to internet technologies:

- TCP/IP Protocols: Co-designed with Robert Kahn, these protocols define how data is transmitted over the internet, enabling diverse networks to interconnect. 
- ARPANET Development: At UCLA, Cerf worked on ARPANET, the precursor to the modern internet, focusing on packet-switching technology. 
- MCI Mail: While at MCI, he led the development of MCI Mail, one of the first commercial email services connected to the internet. 
- Internet Society (ISOC): Co-founded in 1992, ISOC promotes internet standards, education, and policy. 
- ICANN Leadership: Served as chairman of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) from 2000 to 2007, overseeing domain name system management. 
- Interplanetary Internet: Collaborated with NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to develop protocols for space communication, extending internet-like capabilities to interplanetary networks. 

He co-founded the Internet Society (ISOC) in 1992 and served as its first president from 1992 to 1995. Cerf also chaired the board of the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) from 2000 to 2007. In addition to TCP/IP, he played a key role in developing the Internet's architecture and contributed to security technologies during his tenure at the U.S. Department of Defense's Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).

RFC 349 and RFC 1700 both address the assignment of network protocol parameters, such as socket numbers and port numbers, to standardize communication across the Internet.
RFC 349: Authored by Jon Postel in 1972, it proposed the establishment of a centralized authority to assign and manage socket numbers for standard network functions. 
RFC 1700: Published in 1994, it provided a comprehensive list of assigned numbers for various Internet protocols, including port numbers, protocol numbers, and other parameters. This document served as a reference for developers and network administrators to ensure consistent protocol implementation. 
Both RFCs aimed to organize and standardize the allocation of numerical identifiers critical for network operations, facilitating interoperability and stability across the Internet.
