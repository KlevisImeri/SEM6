Layer 3 switch
Connectionless -  no initial exchange of control information to establish an end-to-end connection
Best effort - unreliable

Fragmenting - not in ipv6 by router

Because the router decrements the TTL of each packet, the router must also recalculate the Header Checksum.

Static ARP table entries do not expire over time
