### Exercise 1

A tribe living on a tropical island includes five workers whose time is devoted either to gathering coconuts or to collecting turtle eggs. Regardless of how many other workers are engaged in the same occupation, a worker may gather either 20 coconuts or 10 turtle eggs in a day.
- (a) Draw the production possibility frontier for coconuts and turtle eggs.
- (b) Suppose that a new climbing technique is invented, making the harvesting of coconuts easier. Each worker can now gather 28 coconuts in a day. Draw the new production possibility frontier.

### Exercise 2
Figure 1-1 shows a societyâ€™s production possibility frontier for cameras and watches.
- (a) Identify each of the following combinations of the two goods as either efficient, inefficient, or unattainable:
    - (i) 60 cameras and 200 watches.
    - (ii) 60 watches and 80 cameras.
    - (iii) 300 watches and 35 cameras.
    - (iv) 300 watches and 40 cameras.
    - (v) 58 cameras and 250 watches.
- (b) Suppose the society is producing 300 watches and 40 cameras but wishes to produce an additional 20 cameras. How much output of watches must be sacrificed to enable these cameras to be made?
- (c ) How much output of watches would need to be given up for a further 20 cameras (80 in all) to be produced?
- (d) Explain the difference in the shape of the frontier in Figure 1-1 compared with the ones you drew in Exercise 1.
