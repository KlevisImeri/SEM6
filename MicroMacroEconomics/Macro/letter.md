Dear Professor,

Hope you are doing well!
So here is the problematic question: 

---------
Calculation Question:
In a modern closedeconomy with a two-tier banking system, the economy is dominated by twocommercial banks with a share of 0.6 / (1-0.6) (so on average all money spent ends upin the banks in this proportion). There is no difference in cash holdingsbetween bank customers, with each holding on average 0.11 of their total moneyin cash. Reserves are currently at 2% in both banks and can never fall belowthis level in either bank as this would disrupt the banking system.The smallercommercial bank offers a loan of HUF 598 to its customers, who of course spendthe money. At the end of the transaction, the banks use up their free reserves.

- What is the change in the stock of outstandingloans of the larger bank to the central bank? (use one decimal)
- What is the change in the smaller bank's reserves? (use one decimal)

For the second Question I wrote:
-7.7.
You say Reserves are currently at 2% in both banks therefore a very logical conclusion by me was that we start with HUF 598 on the small bank, because you don't specify exactly where we start (Apparently you wanted the one where you start with nothing in the banks). For 598 HUF in the small bank this implies that witn 2% reserve rate we need to have 598*2% = 11.96R(eserves).
No after you consumer A spends the money you will be left with 4.26 Reserves => the variation of change from my starting point was 4.26-11.96=-7.7 as I wrote.Yes if you start with 0 HUF on the small bank than the variation is 4.26 but you should be more explicit where you start!--------

Question 10
The ruler mints gold coins, be they $. One coin contains 0.28 g of goldand the minting fee is 0.02g of gold. For how many dollars does the monarch endup buying the gold that his subjects put into the mint?
There are two problems when put together cause problems:
1. You don't mention how much you put on the mint. How much gold do you put on the mint?
2. We don't even have the units so we can't even deduce that you wanted $/gram

Question 1
From a model where the sunflower is assumed to maximize the angle of incidence of the sun's rays and the fact that the sunflower cannot count, we can draw the following conclusion: the model is
a.not scientific, because it fails the test of the condition
b.scientific, because it is not the assumptions that need to be tested, but the results of the model
c.scientific, because this example has nothing to do with testing
d. cannot be decided

I answered b and you answered c.This question is so wrongly written. Like we have a model and we have a fact but that fact is not in contradiction with the model => we have not proved or disproved that the model is scientific. For the model to be scientific we need:
- Explains or predicts phenomena.- Is based on empirical data.- Is testable and falsifiable.- Has clear assumptions.- Can be replicated or verified by others.`The model is scientific, because this example has nothing to do with testing` 
Dear Professor,

-------This is just an outside question I was curious about:
A financial asset is
a.an asset worth money
b.the name given to a contractual obligation relating to wealth for the issuer
c.Both of the above statements are true
d.All three statements above are false

I chose c, but apparently b is not a financial asset. So I mean is a financial asset and contractual obligation opposites?
